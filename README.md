## About the Video Course
This course is based on Python 3. You'll master network programmability and network automation using GNS3 and Python 3. This course will show you how you can start programming Cisco networks within 20 minutes. This course is practical; we will show you how you can quickly and easily start network programming by using GNS3, Cisco IOS, and Python. You will see demonstrations showing the configuration of both Cisco routers and switches in GNS3â€”for example, how to configure multiple VLANs on a multiple switches, or how to configure OSPF on a router and more. This course shows you practical examples using Python to programmatically configure Cisco network devices rather than just talking about it. Learn how to automate networks using Telnet, SSH, Paramiko, Netmiko, NAPALM. Tools such as NAPALM and Netmiko make it easy to configure and interact with network devices using an API such as NETCONF or via SSH. Don't reinvent the wheel: use the tools available to you to quickly and easily automate your networks.
